# UrlResolverInterceptor
for intercept the angular2 "UrlResolver" class.

the [official document](http://a2.hubwiz.com/docs/ts/latest/api/compiler/UrlResolver-class.html) has an example shows how to extend and register it.
and the demo here is just for the same purpose, but by another way.

I don't know which way is better, maybe is the inheritance way. 
just for you a reference~
